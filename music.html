    <h1>Shubh Varshney's Favorite Music</h1>
    <p>Who doesn't love music! When I'm doing something and if it seems really quiet or boring, I go to music! However, I often do not pay attention to who I am listening to or what I am listening to. But I do remember some singers and songs that really stood out to me!</p>

    <h2>Song 1: Evidemment by La Zarra</h2>
    <p>I really love this song. I know a bit of French, so this song sounds really beautiful and fulfilling.</p>

    <h2>Song 2: Tu Maan Meri Jaan by Nick Jonas and King</h2>
    <p>This song is a really good mash up between two languages. I know both Hindi and English, and I love how both the singers bring the song together!</p>

    <h2>Song 3: Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley</h2>
    <p>This song is pretty infamous, but I think I've heard it so much it's pretty good. However, it's funny when someone "rickrolls" someone with a song such as this one.</p>

    <p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> playing these songs as well. I'm not so good at it, but I try to learn some of these songs on the piano.</p>
